    <div class="para"><p align="center"><font size="+2">On the theme of "I can change the world by..." I wrote a poem called "Flock of Sheep." This is a poem I wrote, out of distress seeing how peers and members of society ignore those who are being targeted. They choose to stay silent, as they need to be in the group. A member of the flock of sheep. This poem outlines how we must break away from psychology and use our voices to stand up and insight change. This poem is applicable to all issues, as they all are similarly forgotten as there are no voices to champion them. I will change the world and hope others will as well by speaking up.

Describe your reason, steps, and expected outcomes." Title: "Seize the Opportunity" For this theme, I discussed the increasing need of mental health resources. I presented the idea of a chatbot that would be used to talk with people in need of support throughout the tough times.
